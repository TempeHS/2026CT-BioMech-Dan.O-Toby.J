# 2026CT-BioMech-Dan.O-Toby.J

This project is the producing of the bio medicaldevice for Faia. She is a school student that is blind and intellectually mild. To help her naviagte school, w are going to use her ability to sense light to warn her of obstacles that may be present in the school. We are going to prototype systems that can detect motion in front of her, as well as obstacles like blockages, stairs and ramps. This will help her as it will allow her to safely navigate school without using large devices like canes, while simultaneously reducing her reliance on support people for movement.
